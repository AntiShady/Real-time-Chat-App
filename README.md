# Real Time Chat APP 

Based on your request to simplify the UI to a minimalistic design, here is the order of files you should provide me with:

1.  **`HomePage.jsx`**: This is the main page that holds the other components. I need to see its structure to understand how to apply the new design to the overall layout.

2.  **`Sidebar.jsx`**: This component handles the user list and will be a key part of the main page.

3.  **`ChatContainer.jsx`**: This component contains the chat messages and the input field.

4.  **`ChatHeader.jsx`**: This component is a part of the `ChatContainer` and displays the selected user's information.

5.  **`MessageInput.jsx`**: This is the input field for sending messages within the `ChatContainer`.

6.  **`Navbar.jsx`**: This component is likely for navigation and user actions.

7.  **`NoChatSelected.jsx`**: This component is displayed when no chat is active.

8.  **`skeletons` directory**: If you have any skeleton loader components, please provide them.

9.  **`ProfilePage.jsx`**: If the profile page is a separate component, I will need to see its code to simplify it as well.

10. **`LoginPage.jsx` and `SignUpPage.jsx`**: These are crucial for the user authentication flow and need to be simplified.

11. **`SettingsPage.jsx`**: This page for user settings also needs to be simplified.

12. **`App.jsx`**: The main application file to see the routing and overall structure.

Start by providing me with the code for **`HomePage.jsx`**. I will provide the minimal UI version, and we can proceed with the other files in the same way.
